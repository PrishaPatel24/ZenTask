## 1. Principles of Universal Design
- Equitable Use: The translation feature allows users who speak other languages to interact with our program. Since the
  interface is easy to use and straightforward, users with varying levels of technical knowledge can use the program.
- Flexibility in Use: The program has multiple functionalities, including note-taking, checklists for tasks, a calendar
  for event management, language translation, and AI-assisted completion. Users can choose how they interact with the
  program, whether they organize tasks, translate content, or write notes. This accommodates different workflows and
  user needs.
- Simple and Intuitive Use: The program has clearly-labeled buttons like "Translate", "Complete Notes With AI", and "Add
  Task" so that users can intuitively navigate the app. The checklist and calendar are straightforward and allow users to
  add tasks or events without much effort.
- Perceptible Information: Information is presented visually through text areas, dropdown menus, and buttons, which makes
  the program easy to understand. For example, the dropdown menu for language selection is simple and easy to locate,
  and the translation output is displayed in a separate area so that users can distinguish between the original text and
  the translated text.
- Tolerance for Error: If users attempt to translate notes that are too long, the program provides feedback ("Exceeded
  character limit") instead of crashing. The checklist and calendar features allow users to update or remove entries so
  that mistakes can be easily fixed.
- Low Physical Effort: Tasks such as adding events to the calendar, updating the checklist, or translating text are
  simplified and made more efficient for the user. The AI-assisted note completion feature helps users save time and effort
  by automatically filling in ideas or suggestions, so that users donâ€™t have to type it all out themselves.
- Size and Space for Approach and Use: The program can be used on standard desktop or laptop screens and has well-spaced
  buttons and input fields that are easy to access. The dropdown menu and text areas are appropriately sized so that it's
  user-friendly.

## 2. Marketing
If we were to sell or license ZenTask to customers, we would primarily market our program to students and professionals.
Since it has note-taking and translation features, our program would be particularly useful for multilingual users,
exchange students or students studying foreign languages, and professionals who are working in multicultural environments
or abroad. The "Complete Notes with AI" feature is helpful for students and writers needing additional assistance, and
the checklist and calendar features can be used by anyone with a busy schedule that could benefit from organizing their
tasks, deadlines, and scheduled events.

## 3. Demographic Challenges
This program may be less likely to be used by those who are visually impaired since this program does not have
screen readers or voice navigation to make it more suitable for those users. Implementing a text-to-speech feature
would help reach a wider audience of users and make it more accessible. This program is also less likely to be
used by those with dyslexia or reading impairments since it does not include spell-checking and the size of the text cannot
be increased. To accommodate for these users, in the future we could implement a feature that allows people to create
text by speaking instead of typing.

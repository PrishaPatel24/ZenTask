## Summary of the Project
This project focuses on building a productivity app that allows the user to take notes, make a checklist list, and add events to their calendar.
This project was made to serve students, working professionals or anyone who want to better manage life.
Life can be hectic. Our goal is to create peace for the user, allowing them to manage life from one point. 
From the onset of the project, the vision was to find a way to make a student's productivity convenient and all in one place.
So, the authors of the project created a "one-stop" life-management dashboard. 

### User Benefits:
* As a user, you can create a note within the program (although not save it permanently) to probably note down things you do not want to forget. 
To help you, we have included a couple of features, such as translating text to a preferred language and completing your notes using Artificial Intelligence.
* As a user, you can also make a checklist of all your important tasks or things you do not want to procrastinate.
To keep track of things, you can tick off tasks as you go about completing them.
* As a user, you can see your upcoming events at a view while planning to complete your tasks on your checklist or when you are planning time to revisit what you noted down. 

**ZenTask brings everything together!**
